# Meshtastic PingPong + Welcome + Stats Bot

This Python script connects to a Meshtastic device via serial interface and runs a smart bot that:

- Replies with `"pong"` to any `"ping"` message  
- Welcomes new nodes by name (only once)  
- Logs all incoming messages with RSSI, SNR, and hop distance  
- Tracks per-node ping counts and hop stats  
- Prevents reply spam with a cooldown system  
- Ignores its own messages to avoid loops
